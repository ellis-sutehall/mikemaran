								<h2>Newsletter</h2>
                                <p><strong>Newsletter. October 2015.</strong></p>
                                <p>I reflect during these darker evenings on the work I did in the summer on Dante’s 
‘Divine Comedy’ and think about pushing on with something new.</p>
                                <p>I was tempted to call it a day after Dante.  ‘A Divine Comedy’ seems like a good place to finish.  </p>
                                <p>Over the years I have explored the work of  great artists and created dramatic storytelling works for the theatre on diverse topics such as the work of the Scottish psychiarist, R.D.Laing, the American jazz trumpeter, Chet Baker, the great Scottish writer and environmentalist, John Muir, and Picasso and Mahler. Looking back on those productions the Mahler show ‘Song and Dance Man’ stands out because music’s what I like best and I think Mahler is its greatest exponent.  But Dante towers over them all.  Now that I’ve wrestled with Dante I wondered if it might be time to call it a day.</p>
                                <p>When I was studying Picasso I read how towards the end of his life he would go upstairs to his studio to wrestle with the great Spanish master, Velazquez.  Those below could hear Picasso and Velazquez throwing each other around.  It was quite a battle and Picasso needed to win. When I wrestled with Dante there was no competition.  I just wanted to wrestle. And now that I’ve wrestled with Dante why would I want to wrestle with anyone else?  I’ll go back to that question in a minute but let me tell you about the wrestling first.</p>
                                <p>Dante invites you to undertake your own journey through Inferno, a world without love, to climb your own mountain of Purgatorio in search of love, and then to find your own love in Paradiso.  In Dante’s journey the love he finds in heaven is a beautiful woman, Beatrice.  And in the last few lines (there are 14,000 lines in this poem!) she turns to him, smiles, and then turns away.  He loses his girl but gets a beatific vision instead.  At the very moment he loses his girl Dante finds God. I find this happy ending unspeakable sad.  Dante calls her Beatrice.  I have a different name for her and you can call her whatever you like.  She takes you to heaven and leaves you.  To love her is to lose her.  Happy and sad all at once.  Writing this adaptation has been a joyful and a tearful experience and that’s how it was in Edinburgh for me and for the audience too.  Joy and woe – not tea and cakes!</p>
                                <p>So much for Beatrice and Paradiso but what about Dante’s guide through Inferno and Purgatorio. Virgil. What a joy to travel with a maestro like Virgil who knows such a lot but who doesn’t know everyrthing!  Virgil guides Dante as far as reason and intellect will allow – and that is not as far as Paradiso.  I just love it when Dante asks Virgil questions and Virgil doesn’t know the answer.  Virgil is the very best of teachers because he is human – all too human.  And he is wise.  I find his advice to Dante electrifying – ‘Don’t wait to be asked.  He who waits to be asked courts a refusal.’  If nothing else I have learned from Virgil that it’s me, and only me, who responsible for the rejection slips I get.</p>
                                <p>And this brings me to the few words I want to say about a possible future production.</p>
                                <p>Having spent time wrestling with Dante I have it in mind to swap over and wrestle with Virgil.  Instead of having a guide like Virgil I would like to be a guide like Virgil – a great and inspiring teacher – a teacher who is ‘human – all to human.’</p>
                                <p>I have a great and inspiring teacher in mind - Leonard Bernstein.  When I was writing the Mahler show all these years ago I had the pleasure of watching ‘The Little Drummer Boy’ and ‘Four Ways to Say Farewell – TV programmes that Bernstein made about Mahler.  The first programme featured Mahler’s 2nd and The Edinburgh Festival Chorus which was filmed in Ely Cathedral.  I used to be in the choir.  The ‘Farewell’ programme was about Mahler’s 9th.  You can see these and other programmes on Youtube.  I have just finished watching Bernstein’s Norton Lectures – six lectures he gave at Yale University in 1973 with music by the Boston Symphony Orchestra.  In another programme you can watch him rehearsing The Rite of Spring with a Youth Orchestra in Salzburg in English, and in yet another programme rehearsing Mahler 5 with the Vienna Philharmonic in German.  In the world of classical music conductors often seem to be high priests – like Von Karajan. Bernstein was different.  He was charismatic, comfortable with showbiz and a consumate performer.  What Richard Feynman did for physics Leonard Bernstein did for classical music.  And like Feynman he was very very sexy.</p>
                                <p>Bernstein died on October 14th 1990.  He was 72.  The following day I went into the BBC to take part in Kaleidoscope – the Radio 4 Arts Programme.  I had been commissioned to do a book review.  We didn’t do the book.  The whole programme was given over instead to an obituary - a  celebration of Bernstein’s genius – the composer of ‘On the Town,’ ‘West Side Story’, and ‘Candide’,  the public musician who conducted the Israel Philharmonic in Palestine in the late 1940s with bombs exploding all around, who taught the Vienna and Berlin orchestras the music of Mahler – music that was banned by Hitler - and helped these institutions to move away from the anti-semitic horror of Third Reich and into the future,  (a huge achievement with Austrian and German musicians who less than 20 years earlier would have murdered the Jew, Bernstein, and all his relatives), the musical master of ceremonies at the funerals of John F Kennedy and Robert Kennedy, who took the New York Philharmonic on a tour of Russia during the Cold War and  conducted Beethoven’s 9th at The Brandenburg Gate when the wall came down – who led a breathless and breathtaking life until he ultimately ran out of breath leaving his admirers feeling angry because, having failed to look after himself, he robbed the world of ten more years of music-making when he died prematurely.  For most of his life Bernstein suffered from emphysema but would not quit smoking.  He was never without a cigarette.  Towards the end he had an inhaler in one hand and a cigarette in the other.</p>
                                <p>There are so many stories to tell and right now I have no idea how to tell them. Wrestling with Bernstein  is one way to find out – and I will gladly grapple with his genius if only he’d put that cigarette down.  And by the way, if you’ve never heard the overture to ‘Candide’ do yourself a favour – it will make you smile.</p>
