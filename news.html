								<h2>Summer Newsletter</h2>
								<p>Here is a summer newsletter.  It is August in 2017 and the Edinburgh International Festival and Fringe are up and running.  I’m not there.  I have been there most years since 1977 and this year I am elsewhere. I don’t know where.  Somewhere.  But not Edinburgh.  I am in France, or Switzerland, or Italy, or Spain, driving a grey Honda Forza 300 scooter called ‘Modestine’ and keeping a journal.</p>

								<p>In 2009 I drove a scooter from Edinburgh to Rome to raise money for cancer research.  Me and my friend, virtuoso mandolinist, Ali Stephens - we were both recovering from cancer and we both organised the journey.  I drove the scooter to Rome and Ali stayed at home and did the paperwork.  Together we raised £24,000.  I was idle and having such a good time that I failed to keep a diary and when I got back and thought I could write an account of the ride the absence of a written record left a hole I couldn’t fill.  So, eight years later, I’m off again.  This time with a book full of blank pages.  I remember the route well and I’ll follow the same road.  My plan is to write up this trip and, at the same time. to remember the last trip.  So, it will be an account of two journeys.  If I get a decent bit of writing done then the trajectory will be up, up, up! - from the diagnosis of a terminal cancer in 2008 to my arrival in Rome on a bright red Vespa in 2009.  I might write a lot of hot air but I don’t care  - as hot air rises so my story will go ‘up’ like a balloon.  It’ll be a joy to write and there will be tears on the way.  Ali is no longer with us.  Her cancer was more sinister than we had thought and she died in October 2010.  I say ‘died’ but only in a manner of speaking.  For anyone who ever heard her play the mandolin, watched her play football, or listened to her speak - she’s alive as you or me.  And my cousins in Borgotaro, Don Innocente and his sister, Margherita - he was ninety-something and she was a year or two younger - both no longer with us.  Despite his advancing years he was a working parish priest – saying two masses every Sunday in two different villages – driving from one to the other.  You’d be crazy to get in a car with him!  When I arrived in Borgotaro in 2009, Margherita went into the yard and killed a chicken for lunch.  After we had eaten and sampled all the home-made spirits a religious silence descended on the room as Don Innocente switched on the TV to watch the Giro d’Italia.  Cycling was his obsession. There is no reason to return to Borgotaro but, nevertheless, I will, and while I am there I will write down everything that I can remember about them.</p>

								<p>I took a month to go and come back from Rome in 2009.  This year I’ve given myself 3 months.  There’s no hurry.  I am looking forward to striking up conversations in bars, to meet interesting people, and to shore up the decline in my Italian.  I used to be quite good.  Now I’m quite bad.</p>

								<p>Sometime in late October I’ll start the journey home.  I’ll drive to Livorno and take the ferry to Barcelona.  Then I’ll drive on the old road to Bilbao keeping the Pyrenees on my right and from Bilbao I’ll take the ferry to Portsmouth – travelling north into the wintertime.</p>

								<p>So, I hope you’ll understand why neither my body nor my soul is in Edinburgh this year.  I’m on the road.  The Fringe will not feel abandoned by me.  I will miss all my Scottish friends but I hope to make new Italian friends.</p>

								<p>A few more words about Scottish friends.  John Brown (technical manager), Colin Steele (trumpet), Fraser Urquhart (piano) and me (writer and actor), all of us Scots, took our musical drama about the music and life of American West Coast trumpet icon and drug addict, Chet Baker, on tour in Scotland in May and June.  What a joy!  We were joined for the last night in Crathes Village Hall by the production’s director, Patrick Sandford who is a sort of Irish, French, Englishman.  We have had this show in our repertoire since 2009 and the team have grown into a close family.  We all get withdrawal symptoms if we don’t revisit the show and tour it regularly.  It was my first production in post cancer era.  That first tour took us on the road throughout March and April 2009 and we performed most nights except Mondays.  Every other Monday I dashed home to Cambridge for my fortnightly chemotherapy sessions at Addenbrookes.  I don’t know which contributed more to my survival – the tour or the chemo.  I remember sitting up in my hospital bed a few days after the Whipples procedure (which left me with a redesigned and perfectly functioning digestive system) negotiating fees with theatre directors and booking hotel rooms.  I had no thoughts of dying – I had too many other things in mind.</p>

								<p>There are a few special venues – places that invite us to return year after year.  Crathes Hall, run by the delightful printmaker, Nicola Chambury, is one.  So is Eden Court Theatre in Inverness run by the equally delightful artistic director, Colin Marr.  It has been tricky keeping up with them.  I’m a slow writer.  But Patrick Sandford (director – although he prefers to be called ‘referee’) has written a one-man show, ‘Groomed.’  Patrick has often come on the road to support me.  I want to return the favour and to go on the road with him.  One of my ambitions for next year is to drive him with his own production to some of our venues, stage manage, and make the tea.</p>

								<p>My Gustav Mahler/Leonard Bernstein novel is proceeding slowly.  The story starts in 1900 in Vienna and finishes in in 1965 in Edinburgh.  I’ve reached 1913 - still a long way to go. It’s a joy to write, travelling hopefully, possibly never arriving, and I’m in no hurry.  Then there’s the scooter book - ‘Travels in the Appenines with a Vespa.’  The Vespa in 2009 was called ‘Rosie’.  She got written off by a careless motorist when I was driving from Cambridge to London to meet Patrick for lunch.  I was carrying pizzas and two bottles of wine which ended up all over the A10.  The police thought I was a pizza delivery boy.  I got away with a few cuts and bruises but lost the Vespa.  The new Honda is called ‘Modestine’ after the more famous donkey.  When Robert Louis Stevenson travelled in the Cevennes with that stubborn donkey he carried a revolver and plentiful supply of tobacco.  I will do without both and what I lack in literary prowess I’ll make up in horse power.</p>

								<p>I will be back at the beginning of November and will write again then.  Ciao!  Mike</p>
