                <h2>Newsletter 2020</h2>

                <p>Dear Reader,</p>

                <p>
                  I have been touched recently by the good wishes for my
                  retirement and concerns for my health so I thought I should
                  write to tell you that I am neither retired nor dead but in
                  robust health and very happy to be working.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I no longer spend August in Edinburgh doing one or two shows a
                  day during the fringe but I am not retired. I’m busy doing
                  other things elsewhere.
                </p>

                <p>
                  After I wrote the last newsletter I was supposed to set off
                  for Rome on my scooter – a Honda Forza 300cc called
                  ‘Modestine.’
                </p>

                <p>
                  Well, I didn’t go. I booked the scooter on the ferry, marked
                  up the map with my stopping points, programmed the sat nav,
                  then went to the doctor to get a month’s supply of medicine.
                  She gave me a quick check up and didn’t like the look of
                  something. Possible melanoma. Another doctor, then a skin
                  specialist, then minor surgery, then a six week wait for the
                  result of the biopsy. By the time I got the result that there
                  was no problem the wind had gone out of my sails.
                </p>

                <p>
                  However, during the month I was neither in Italy or Edinburgh
                  I discovered my garden. I spent August digging and cutting and
                  I now have a market garden which provides me with courgettes,
                  potatoes and beans, a greenhouse full of tomatoes, peppers and
                  aubergines, and a cold frame with enough chillies to fuel a
                  rocket to the moon.
                </p>

                <p>
                  In March 2018 I became a grandfather and have all the joy of
                  looking after the most beautiful, innocent, happy child. She’s
                  the apple of her parents’ eye and the jewel in my crown. I’m
                  70 and she’s 1 so robust health has become even more important
                  to me.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Busy gardening and grandfathering and not showing up at the
                  Edinburgh festival I suppose I might appear to be somewhat
                  retired.
                </p>

                <p>Nope!</p>

                <p>
                  I rehearsed a new version of ‘Did You used to be R.D.Laing?’
                  with a new pianist, Alan Benzie and we took it on the road to
                  village halls in Aberdeenshire. Colin Steele and I took ‘A
                  Funny Valentine’ to a cabaret in Strasbourg. ‘R.D.Laing’ and
                  ‘Funny Valentine’ are both available for touring throughout
                  2020 and I’m working on the diary now.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I’m writing a fictional biography of William Hildebrand who
                  was Mahler’s (fictional) gofer and chauffeur (Mahler didn’t
                  have one!) and who became Leonard Bernstein’s gofer and
                  chauffeur (Bernstein did have one but his name wasn’t William)
                  The action takes place between 1900 and William’s death in
                  1965.
                </p>

                <p>
                  A lot of my writing over the years has been carefully
                  researched. The joy of fiction is making it up instead of
                  looking it up. Alma Mahler’s biographers will be astonished to
                  discover what William discovered as he chauffeured her around.
                  My flights of fancy treat Alma rather better than do her
                  biographers.
                </p>

                <p>
                  If the story of William Hildebrand, 1882 – 1965, who looked
                  after Gustav Mahler and then Leonard Bernstein, ever gets made
                  into a film the music will, of course, be fantastic!
                </p>

                <p>
                  Oh, and the ride to Rome on a scooter called ‘Modestine’ –
                  that’s still to happen. This year I was all set to leave for
                  Rome when my brother fell seriously ill. I spent most of
                  August at his bedside. But next year I’ll do it, I really
                  will, and then I’ll write it up and make another book.
                </p>

                <p>
                  This next book will be an account of a scooter ride to Rome
                  following the route of my first scooter ride to Rome in 2009
                  which I did as a fund-raising effort to raise money for cancer
                  research. I never kept a diary on that first ride so in order
                  to write about it I’ll do it all over again – this time with a
                  notebook and pencil. My second trip to Rome will revisit the
                  first, stopping at the same places and sleeping under the
                  stars, just like the first time when it never rained – not a
                  single drop. (I should be so lucky next time!) I’d like to
                  write a book that starts with the diagnosis of my cancer in
                  June 2008 and ends with my arrival in Rome on a scooter just
                  over a year and two operations later – a story with an upward
                  trajectory don’t you think? I have been living in the land of
                  the healthy ever since.
                </p>

                <p>
                  In 2020 there are plans to tour ‘Did You Used to be
                  R.D.Laing?’ in Scotland and ‘A Funny Valentine’ (the Chet
                  Baker Story with Colin Steele on trumpet) at the Cambridge
                  Jazz Festival and other venues in England. I hope to see you
                  there.
                </p>

                <p>Ciao!</p>

                <p>Mike</p>
