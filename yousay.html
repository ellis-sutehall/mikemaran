								<h2>What You Say</h2>
								<h5>A selection of audience comments about some Mike Maran productions.</h5>
								<p class="newshead2">'We saw your performance at the MAC Birmingham, it was brilliantly performed and so entertaining. It's given a new meaning to Mahler's music. Well done.'</p>
								<p class="newstext">Linda Woodhouse, UK, October 2004</p>
								<p class="newshead2">'A thoroughly enjoyable evening and an excellent performance.'</p>
								<p class="newstext">Jess Stirling, Linlithgow, UK, August 2004</p>
								<p class="newshead2">'I saw <i>The Little World of Don Camillo</i> on Saturday at Keyworth. I was prompted to attend by the fact thatI too enjoyed reading the stories at my grandmother's house as a child. I thoroughly enjoyed the evening and could have listened to much more.'</p>
								<p class="newstext">Kathryn Hewitt, Nottingham, UK, September 2005</p>
								<p class="newshead2">'Went to <i>Captain Corelli's Mandolin</i> in Carrbridge Village Hall - excellent show - much better than the film! Mike should have had a say in the film version!'</p>
								<p class="newstext">Ann Irvine, Inverness, UK, September 2005</p>
								<p class="newshead2">'<i>Don Camillo </i>- saw it last Friday at The Byre. Absolutely fabulous. What a wonderful raconteur you are Mike Maran. A great evening. Will look forward to the next one....'</p>
								<p class="newstext">Heather Banner, St. Andrews, UK, June 2005</p>
								<p class="newshead2">'Having been to Cephalonia before knowing about <i>Captain Corelli's Mandolin</i>, we instantly fell for the island &amp; its people who make you seem part of the family. Making return trips somewhat emotional - something thats never happened about a place we have visited before. But that emotion was felt once again at the palace theatre watching your show it made us laugh and it made us cry - it bought back memories, fantastic keep it up.'</p>
								<p class="newstext">Brian &amp; Sue Bull, Redditch, UK, March 2002</p>
								<p class="newshead2">'What a way to tell a story, just beautiful in every respect. My life has obviously been the poorer for not having seen your other earlier productions.'</p>
								<p class="newstext">Donald McGilchrist, St.Andrews, Scotland April 2002</p>
								<p class="newshead2">'The whole audience was absolutely spellbound - you could have heard a pin drop for over an hour. Enjoyed it so much I had to go again - and it was even better the second time!'</p>
